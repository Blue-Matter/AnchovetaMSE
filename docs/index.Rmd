### Principal Research Questions

* Is it possible and practical to manage a stock like Peruvian Anchoveta, and its boom-and-bust
population cycles, with a harvest strategy informed by a management strategy evaluation?

* What other management approaches/measures (e.g., spatial measures) and considerations,
consistent with precautionary ecosystem-based fisheries management, may be applicable?

### Project status (33%)

Completed:

* Operating model specified and fitted

In progress:

* Designing and running a range of harvest strategies
* Write up results in a draft report (see below)

### Draft Report

A private Google doc is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYY8692lybi8d1tWeWUGGOlFiExEBEoJNpnuRanUrHM/edit).

### Appendices

A detailed description of the Reference Case operating model is available in [Appendix 1](Reports/Peruvian_Anchoveta.html) which includes justifications and references in support of the various population and fishing dynamics. 

The operating model was conditioned on publicly available data published in [Oliveros-Ramos 2010](Paper/Oliveros - Ramos 2010.pdf). Operating model estimates and statistical properties of model fit are available in a detailed [operating model conditioning report](Reports/RCM.html)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***

### Apps

The Reference Case operating model has been uploaded to the [Reference Point Calculator App](apps.bluematterscience.com/RPC). 

Once you have selected this case study you can investigate historical reference points and test a range of harvest strategies.

### Source Code and Objects 

The raw code and openMSE objects required to run the MSE are available in the public [Anchoveta MSE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/Anchoveta MSE/)

Code is provided below on how to install and run examples from the package. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***

### Running an example MSE for Anchoveta

The operating model is available from a R package in a GitHub repository. You can install it from GitHub:

```{r packageinstall,echo=T, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github('blue-matter/AnchovettaMSE')
library(AnchovettaMSE)

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***

### Demonstration Code

```{r demo, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(openMSE)
library(AnchovettaMSE)

avail('MP') # a list of available MPs. Those starting 'PA' are designed for use with Peruvian Anchoveta

avail('OM') # a list of operating models. Those starting 'PA' are Peruvian Anchoveta operating models
testMSE<-runMSE(PA_RefCase,MPs=c("PA_F30","PA_F40"))
plot(testMSE)
  
```
